            <p>
                My name is Peace Anwana, I am currently studying software development (Cloud Engineering) at Altschool Africa with 
                an ambition to do great and stand out in the tech ecosystem.<br>
                One of my key attributes is Continuous Improvement and Integration.<br>
                I possess a keen enthusiasm for exploring novel ideas.
                I am 'Tenacious', due to my great ability to persevere and overcome
                challenges in various aspects of my life.<br> "Giving up is never an option for me, and it
                won't start now".
                I enjoy a diverse range of music genres, each providing a comporting companion to my soul.<br>
                I have a particular fondness for self-help literature, because i love to read and listen to people's
                stories.
